Project0 CS50W - Personal website

This is a website about me as a computer science student. There are 5 html pages. Firstly, the home page, which includes a summary of the website. An about page, describing my interests. A portfolio page, which has links to past programming work I have done. A cv page, where my cv can be downloaded and it also includes a list of languages and technologies that I am learning and lastly, a contact page which has details of how to contact me. Each page has a navigation bar that links to the other pages, a header container with a background picture and the main section. There is also a static folder which includes images, a css style file and a scss file.
